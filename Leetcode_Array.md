### 41. First Missing Positive (Hard)
>Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.
>
>Note: Your algorithm should run in $O(n)$ time and uses constant extra space.

**Required Solution:**
We can only do constant linear search and operation in place. The idea is like sorting. If we have a sorted array without negative numbers or 0. Then we can loop over the array and return the first index i plus 1 that is not equal to nums[i]. (As the index of array is 0 based, the sorted index should have `nums[0]==1` and so on.) Also notice that if a value is greater than `len[nums]`, we can omit that value as we are expecting an array from 1 to `len(nums)`. So the algorithm is to implement [count sort](#count-sort) within range value 1 to `len(nums)` inplace.

The solution code:
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i=0
        while i < len(nums):
            value = nums[i]
            if (value>0) and (value<= len(nums)) and (nums[value-1]!=nums[i]):
                nums[i], nums[value-1] = nums[value-1], nums[i]
            else:
                i+=1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i+1 !=nums[i]:
                return i+1
        
        return len(nums)+1
```

## Appendix:
### Count Sort: (Wikipedia)
**Introduction:**
In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.

Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a comparison sort, and the Î©(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorting does not apply to it. Bucket sort may be used for many of the same tasks as counting sort, with a similar time analysis; however, compared to counting sort, bucket sort requires linked lists, dynamic arrays or a large amount of preallocated memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort instead stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.

**The Algorithm:**
In pseudocode, the algorithm may be expressed as:
```
count = array of k+1 zeros
for x in input:
   count[key(x)] += 1

total = 0
for i in 0, 1, ... k:
   count[i], total = total, count[i] + total

output = array of the same length as input
for x in input:
   output[count[key(x)]] = x
   count[key(x)] += 1 

return output
```
Here input is the input array to be sorted, key returns the numeric key of each item in the input array, count is an auxiliary array used first to store the numbers of items with each key, and then (after the second loop) to store the positions where items with each key should be placed, k is the maximum value of the non-negative key values and output is the sorted output array.

In summary, the algorithm loops over the items in the first loop, computing a histogram of the number of times each key occurs within the input collection. After that, it then performs a prefix sum computation on count to determine, for each key, the position range where the items having that key should be placed in; i.e. items of key {\displaystyle i}i should be placed starting in position `count[i]`. This is done through the second loop. Finally, it loops over the items again in the third loop, moving each item into its sorted position in the output array. The relative order of items with equal keys is preserved here; i.e., this is a stable sort.
